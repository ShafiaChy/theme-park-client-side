## About my project
<ol>
    <li>It is a theme park website for purchasing tickets to get access to Thorpe rides and other offers.It focuses on front-end and backend developments.</li>
    <li>It is a responsive website made with <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b></li>
    <li>Implemented the Bootstrap framework for developing a responsive website for devices of different sizes</li>
    <li>Has two-way login systems (Google and Email/Password) via Firebase for the users and the admin</li>
    <li></li>
    <li><b>Firebase</b> is used for authentication and <b>MongoDB</b> database is used to store the data</li>
    <li><b>React Router Dom</b> is used to navigate the routes.</li>
    <li>The website allows the users to buy tickets by clicking a button.</li>
    <li>When the BUY NOW button is clicked the user will be directed to the Place Order page. If, however, the user is not logged in, they will be led to the login page.After logging in with valid information, the users will be rediected to the Place Order</li>
    <li>The PlaceOrder, Add a New Service, My Order and Manage Orders are private routes. These routes will only be shown when the users are logged in.</li>
    <li>The website uses react-router-dom so it doesnt reload the page everytime a link on the navbar is clicked.</li>
    <li>The private routes do not take the users to the login page when they are reloaded. </li>
    <li>Users can delete their orders from the My Order page.</li>
    <li>Admin can approve or delete orders by simply clicking the respective buttons.</li>
    <li>When the 'Approved' button is clicked, the status will get updated from 'Pending' to 'Approved'.</li>
    <li>Admin can add a new service by filling up the form on Add a New Service Page.</li>
    <li>Dialog boxes will appear each time a button is clicked to notify the completion of the process to the users and the admin</li>
    <li>The header and footer doesnt will not disappear during navigation.</li>
