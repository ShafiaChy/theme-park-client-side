## About my project
<ol>
    <li>Thorpe Park is a website for purchasing tickets to get access to Thorpe rides and other offers.</li>
    <li>The website allows the users to buy tickets by clicking a button.</li>
    <li>When the BUY NOW button is clicked the user will directed to the Place Order page. If, however, the user is not logged in, they will be taken to the login page.After logging in with valid information, the users will rediected to Place Order</li>
    <li>The PlaceOrder, Add a New Service, My Order and Manage Orders are private routes. These routes will only be shown when the users are logged in.</li>
    <li>The website uses react-router- dom so it doesnt load the page everytime a link on the navbar is clicked.</li>
    <li>Users can delete their orders from the My Order page.</li>
    <li>Admin can approve or delete orders by simply clicking the respective buttons.</li>
    <li>When the 'Approved' button is clicked, the status will get updated from 'Pending' to 'Approved'.</li>
    <li>Admin can add a new service by filling up the form on Add a New Service Page.</li>
    <li>Dialog boxes will appear each time a button is clicked to notify the completion of the process to the users and the admin</li>
